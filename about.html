            <h1>Raechele Anne Yarza, Dep. Head of Kindergarten</h1>
            <p>I have been teaching at CIA FIRST International School since 2015. Now as the Deputy Head of Kindergarten, I support the Head of Kindergarten with day to day operations of the department. In the last five years, my practice has been centred around Kindergarten ages 3 to 5. Alongside teaching, I have also served as a Subject Coordinator in K3 Level. This involved me in writing, modifying and refining units of study to academic standards, School-wide Learning Outcomes (SLOs) and the principles on Understanding by Design. I have also made performance tasks and rubrics to assess unit goals. 
     
                <br><br>​I believe that each student has unique strengths and that their learning styles vary. Teacher instruction must be differentiated to give adequate support and challenge for all students to develop genuine love and passion for learning.
                    
                <br><br>​Same as the famous pragmatist, John Dewey, I believe that education should be about life and growth. Education should be student-centered, interactive and practical. The teacher should be a facilitator of learning, not a lecturer. Students should experience real-life learning that will allow them to maximize their potential and build their character, leading them to be globally competitive individuals. 
                     
                <br><br>CIA FIRST students are empowered to grow, learn, socialize and achieve. By providing high-quality teaching practices and the best conditions for learning which equip them with the knowledge, skills and dispositions for lifelong learning, every CIA FIRST student can be a holistic individual who can exceed not only in the academe but in the real world.

        <div class="about-col">
            <h1>Resie Fernandez, Head of Elementary School</h1>
            <p>My name is Resie Fernandez, currently serving as the Head of Elementary School. I come from the Philippines but have been living in Cambodia for the past 17 years. I was a teacher for 21 years and promoted to different school leadership positions. The experience honed my skills in equipping and building the capacity of the people around me, especially my team. After completing my master’s degree in 2003, I moved to Cambodia and taught university students in the area of principles and methods of teaching.
 
                <br><br>For eight years, I worked with my students in reaching their communities; providing English classes to children, and working alongside them in small community development projects. Following these eight years of working with students, I managed a Singaporean owned language school. I led a team of national teachers and trained them to implement the Cambridge English Program and Singapore Maths.
                
                <br><br>I believe education is transformation. When a real learning process takes place, it changes the person’s perspective about himself/herself, family, community, and the world. I believe it is important to develop students’ mindset and their ability to think. Change of perspective begets a change of behavior that results in a transformation of life. 
                
                <br><br>In 2016, I joined the CIA FIRST International School community as a teacher. Being a part of the CIA FIRST International School leadership now is truly a privilege. I am drawn to CIA’s commitment to “envisioning new heights of achievement for the individual learner and everything within his/ her reach and power to influence: family, community, the world…”  Every student is created with unique potential and ability. I also believe that each student has a dream, ambition, and aspiration in life. I envision elementary students, learning to think and stand up for themselves as they move up to Middle School and High School, yet humbly listen to the wise guidance of their elders and teachers. ​

            <p>My name is Matthew Allen, currently serving as the Deputy Head of Elementary (Sen Sok). I come from the UK and have been living in Cambodia for the past 7 years. I have graduated from the University of Liverpool with a Bachelor of Chemistry with honours and spent four years working in the chemical industry for major global companies. I am currently studying a PGCert with the University of Essex.
     
                <br><br>I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here in Cambodia, it is a wonderful country rich in culture and kind hearted people. Everyday I am inspired to be as dedicated as I can to inspire the next generation of Cambodian citizens. I am passionate about guiding our young learners on their journey to achieve their full potential. I have especially enjoyed my time teaching here along with the massive learning curve that came with it. It has been a personal learning journey, and one that I have always been open to continuous learning, and striving for self improvement.
                    
                <br><br>I feel proud and privileged to work at CIA FIRST and am fully committed to fostering the school’s vision and mission. The school is full of dedicated educators who are skilled and knowledgeable in delivering 21st century learning. Our spacious and well equipped campuses are the perfect places to nurture a child’s educational journey.

            <h1>Greg Heaney, Head of Middle School</h1>
            <p>My name is Greg Heaney, I am an Australian and this is my fifth year with CIA FIRST. For the last three years, I was fortunate enough to manage the talented and dedicated teachers of our Middle and High School Physical Science department. Before coming to Cambodia, I worked in International Schools in China for 10 years. 
 
                <br><br>Working for CIA FIRST has been the highlight of my teaching career, we have something truly special here that I have not seen anywhere else and I am very proud to be a part of it. The level of engagement of our students and their ability to think critically and independently is something to be truly proud of. 
                
                <br><br>​While I was teaching, I was a big proponent of the Constructivist method. I believe the best and most meaningful way for students to learn something is by doing it. This fits perfectly into the teaching philosophy here at CIA FIRST in providing students with meaningful transfer goals with real world applications as a fundamental part of our assessment process.
                
                <br><br>As Middle School principal, I see my role as helping these adolescent students through what is a difficult time in their lives as they grow and develop into young adults. That period of their lives has been thrown into even more uncertainty and stress given the current situation we are faced concerning Covid-19, studying online and prolonged isolation. 
                
                <br><br>It is my sincere wish that we guide these students through this difficult time instilling in them the  mindset that they are not victims of these circumstances, but that they are victors. I want to encourage perseverance and resourcefulness and give them a sense of pride and achievement, that during these difficult times they were able to answer the challenge presented to them, adapt and overcome. So in years from now they will not look back on these days with dread, but with pride of what they were able to achieve during what will be a period long remembered in history.

            <h1>Joyce Ira Yarza, Dep. Head of Middle School</h1>
            <p>As Albert Einstein once said, “It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.” With my current role as the Deputy Head of Middle School, I am bringing with me my 14 years of experience as a teacher to better serve and understand the growing community of our middle school students. Adolescence is a time where students look for more encouragement, seeks acceptance and recognition for everything they do, a period of transition for personal growth and development, and a time where hopes can easily be crushed with one wrong decision-making.
     
                <br><br>​With all the changes that could possibly happen, I would like to be the students’ comfort-zone whenever they need assistance. I am there to listen when they have questions while giving them the full autonomy to find solutions to their problems. I will help them become independent and responsible until they become successful. I will allow them to express themselves while understanding the consequences that may happen if their expectations are not met. I will treat them equally with respect so they could mirror it in everything they do. The strength of our students relies on the relationship we build with them and together they will realize how they can improve themselves. ​
                    
                <br><br>Putting students at the center, I envision CIA FIRST students to enjoy learning through different engaging activities. When students understand their strengths and weaknesses, they will be able to set realistic goals that foster self-directed learning based on their interest and readiness. Through providing a safe and nurturing environment, students feel the support and take risks when learning. They will continue to explore the world around them and will respond to feedback that motivates to achieve success.

            <p>It is a pleasure to introduce you to CIA FIRST International High School. Our school and its programmes provide a unique and successful study pathway within the international school community located in Phnom Penh.
 
                <br><br>I have recently joined CIA FIRST as the High School Principal.  The purpose of education for me is to promote lifelong learning. I graduated from Massey University with a BSc. in Genetics and my PGCE in Secondary Education as an adult, and I am currently working on the completion of my Principals Certification through Harvard University.  I have had various teaching and leadership roles in several International Schools in the UAE, China, Ethiopia, and Vietnam.
                
                <br><br>​What makes CIA FIRST truly unique is that we have developed our own curriculum which has been approved by the Ministry of Education. Our curriculum focuses on establishing positive learning relationships between students and teachers, which creates independent learners who can think for themselves, challenge traditional ideas and forge new pathways.
                
                <br><br>​Our staff are professional, caring and committed individuals, whose sole purpose every day is to provide an outstanding educational experience for each child.
                I invite you to spend time on our website, learning more about us, our learning philosophy, and all the wonderful resources we have for your child and even
                ​or our parents! 
                 
                <br><br>I am so honored to be part of a school that shows so much ambition and perseverance to provide high-quality education at affordable rates. I sincerely applaud the hard work and dedication of our students along with the support given to them by our excellent staff. Our parents will be very proud and deservedly so, as they have played such a pivotal role in their child’s success.

            <h1>Shane Hatcher, Head of High School</h1>
            <p>It is a huge privilege and honour to have been promoted as a High School Deputy Principal (Pastoral Care) at CIA FIRST in 2020-21. My journey with the school for the last 9 years has been highly enriching as I was given the opportunity to serve and learn at different roles from a Mathematics teacher to Subject Coordinator, and recently as school wide Community Engagement Learning Coordinator. My fundamental philosophy as a passionate educator, who works hard to empower the students in becoming lifelong learners is to employ high expectations, strong relationships and personalized learning goals to get the best from every student, giving them ownership of their own, personal learning journey.
 
                <br><br>I am very proud to call Cambodia my home, having lived here now for nearly 10 years. Prior to teaching, I gained my customer service experience through working in different hotels at the beginning of my career and then moved to banking, finance and call center management positions. After joining the education sector in 2010, I have been fortunate enough to be in the unique position, whereby I have taught different age groups of students ranging from Elementary to the High School including university levels (Masters & Bachelors) as a lecturer, which gives me diverse understanding of student developmental needs and pedagogical frameworks.
                
                <br><br>​What makes CIA FIRST truly unique is that we have developed our own curriculum which has been approved by the Ministry of Education. Our curriculum focuses on establishing positive learning relationships between students and teachers, which creates independent learners who can think for themselves, challenge traditional ideas and forge new pathways.
                
                <br><br>I studied Hotel Management and Catering Technology after high school and gained a Bachelors in Commerce from Delhi University. Later as a working professional, I studied MBA in Human Resource and Marketing through an American Express management trainee program from Amity University, India. After joining CIA FIRST in Aug 2012, I had the privilege to study PGCEi (Education) from University of Nottingham, UK and I am also currently pursuing my MA in Educational Leadership & Management through the same University, where my dissertation is focussed on Implementation of Schoolwide Restorative Practices in an International School Context. 
                 
                <br><br>Outside of school, I have many interests including going on new adventures and discovering new places, however sports and fitness has always played a huge part in my life. I enjoy keeping fit and running. I’ve completed 5 Angkor half marathons, all of them were run for CIA FIRST along with our High School students. In indoor sports, I enjoy chess and table tennis occasionally. I look forward to leading CIA FIRST students and staff to new heights of achievement.
