            <p>CIA FIRST International School’s high-quality early care and education programs have a significant impact on children’s future success. A warm, responsive relationship with a highly-trained teaching staff is foundational.
 
                <br><br>At CIA FIRST, we believe that children learn best through experimentation and discovery facts, processes and concepts on their own.
                
                <br><br>Instead of being asked to memorize facts or learn by listening, children utilize materials, in turn experiment, make assumptions and discover by themselves.
                <br><br>​We create a learning environment for young children that stimulates and engages their curiosity of the world around them and meets their physical and emotional needs so they feel safe and secure. Playfulness is the child’s natural state of mind and therefore influences all of the child’s domains of development including physical, cognitive, linguistic, social, and emotional.

            <p>CIA FIRST has developed and embedded activities throughout our curricular program that prompt learners to interact, think and reflect with an objective of providing a well-rounded child that is fully prepared for life ahead.
     
                <br><br>​CIA FIRST’s students recognize the importance of self-respect, confidence, and interpersonal skills.
                <br>​Our curriculum aims to teach children empathy along with traditional academic skills.
                    
                <br><br>CIA FIRST’s kindergarten students begin to understand mathematical concepts such as shapes, size, building structures and solving construction problems.
                     
                <br><br>It is our aim to develop and support cognitive thinking and reasoning, which are vital throughout a child’s lifespan to prepare them for their mathematical future. CIA FIRST’s kindergarten curricula program includes rhyming, finger play, songs, clapping syllables, and matching beginning sounds activities. Therefore, our students develop an ability to combine syllables into words and words into sentences. The students also learn to make predictions, develop critical-thinking, make connections between their lives and stories, and retell stories.

            <p>​The Elementary School at CIA FIRST is full of excitement, high expectations, and a fun five years of learning during these formative years. Here the students are coming to school with their eyes wide and hands ready to work individually and in groups.
 
                <br><br>CIA FIRST believes that elementary learning is one of the most vital parts of nurturing a child for the future. We believe that children experimenting and unearthing concepts and processes themselves, is the best way to develop well-rounded individuals, rather than simply memorizing facts.
                <br><br>CIA FIRST believes that working as part of a team is an essential life skill and the school puts emphasis on ensuring children can operate collectively among their peers. This helps build the confidence of children and also leads them to communicate their ideas clearly on an individual basis.  They are provided with instructions aligned to international standards. 
                ​
                
                <br><br>As well as introducing children to subjects including maths, IT and combined natural sciences, the school begins integrating the 16 “Habits of Mind” learning process, which serves to aid students in working through real-life problems by using intentional strategies to gain positive outcomes.

        <div class="about-col">
            <p>By Middle School, students at CIA FIRST International School will continue their self-discovery and will start formulating an individual worldview. The syllabus will open up students to new abstract ideas and expose them to multiple perspectives which will aid their development in thinking.
 
                <br><br>This comes down to the philosophy of not imposing a particular worldview on students. The classroom is seen as a place to promote debate and discussion, allowing students to explore a wealth of opposing ideas to construct their own opinion. Students will not be told what to think but how to think.
                
                <br><br>At the middle school level, CIA FIRST ’s students are at a time of life where they are seeking to establish their own social identity. The middle school curriculum invites the students to explore the big ideas in life, examining such concepts as morality, justice, social structure and civic responsibility.

While Middle School is very much focused on acting as a forum to promote debate and discussion to develop critical thinking, High School is more content-based as students are prepared for vital exams. Students will now be enacting CIA FIRST’s Habits of Mind on a day-to-day basis as they prepare to enter higher education and the professional world.

        <div class="about-col">
            <div class="list">
                    <p class="listp">Its two key ideas are contained in the title:
                    ​</p>

                    <li>focus on teaching and assessing for understanding and learning transfer, and</li>

            <h5>The UbD framework is based on seven key tenets: </h5>
            <div class="list">
                <ol>
                    <li>Learning is enhanced when teachers think purposefully about curricular planning. The UbD framework helps this process without offering a rigid process or prescriptive recipe. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Learning is enhanced when teachers think purposefully about curricular planning. The UbD framework helps this process without offering a rigid process or prescriptive recipe. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Understanding is revealed when students autonomously make sense of and transfer their learning through authentic performance. Six facets of understanding—the capacity to explain, interpret, apply, shift perspective, empathize, and self-assess—can serve as indicators of understanding. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Effective curriculum is planned backward from long-term, desired results through a three-stage design process (Desired Results, Evidence, and Learning Plan). This process helps avoid the common problems of treating the textbook as the curriculum rather than a resource, and activity-oriented teaching in which no clear priorities and purposes are apparent. 
                    </li>
                    <li> Teachers are coaches of understanding, not mere purveyors of content knowledge, skill, or activity. They focus on ensuring that learning happens, not just teaching (and assuming that what was taught was learned); they always aim and check for successful meaning making and transfer by the learner.
                    </li>
                    <li>Regularly reviewing units and curriculum against design standards enhances curricular quality and effectiveness, and provides engaging and professional discussions.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="left">
                <p>The UbD framework reflects a continual improvement approach to student achievement and teacher craft. The results of our designs—student performance—inform needed adjustments in curriculum as well as instruction so that student learning is maximized.
                    <br><br>
                    The Understanding by Design framework is guided by the confluence of evidence from two streams—theoretical research in cognitive psychology, and results of student achievement studies. A summary of the key research that undergirds UbD framework can be found at www.ascd.org under Research A Topic.
